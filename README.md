## 👋 Hi, I’m Krisha!

I’m a Computer Science student at the University of Georgia (UGA) with an AI emphasis, specializing in full-stack web development and machine learning applications. I’m passionate about turning ideas into real, user-ready products, especially tools that help communities, students, or education systems.

I’m currently developing multiple full-stack apps, ML projects, and research-based tools while preparing for Software Engineering internships.

### 🚀 Career Goals

- Secure a Software Engineering internship (SWE)
- Become a strong full-stack + AI/ML engineer
- Build real-world, high-impact projects
- Use AI to support accessibility & education

### 💬 Outside of Code

I love reading, mentoring other students, volunteering, and brainstorming new product ideas. I’m always working to improve as a developer, thinker, and builder.
